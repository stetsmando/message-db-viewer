# Message DB Viewer

This is a prototype tool built for [MessageDB](https://github.com/message-db/message-db).

## Getting Started

This tool is built mainly using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and vanilla JS to update the page.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have [Node v18+](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

You will also need [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### Set Up

1. Clone the repo locally.
2. Run `yarn install`.
3. Start MessageDB by running `yarn messagedb:up`.
4. Seed your own messages or run `yarn seed` to get some example data.
5. Run the server with `yarn run`. This should open a browser window hosting the tool.
